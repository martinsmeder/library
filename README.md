Live demo: https://martinsmeder.github.io/library/

A browser based library app. Powered by webpack and firebase!

Some things I've learned:

- How to work with tables and forms in javascript
- How to create an overlay effect
- How to implement a database using firebase's cloud firestore
- How to implement google sign in using firebase's authentication
- How to work with environment variables (even though it didn't really make a difference in this project)
